# React-start
This repository will consist of really easy examples of React apps and will end in more of complex ones. Nothing to brag about, this will only be my 'safe-place' to store basic content. 

1) <b>Components:</b> First React App. Review how to create and add properties to a component and how to add custom methods.
2) <b>Props and state: </b> Composing components, using states, setStates, passing state as props. Also conditional (and asynchronic) rendering. 
3) <b>Library: </b>Library app (quite ugly one, but good for practise), that uses basic features of React and api (like commercials). Also all components from react are stored in different files, so have that in mind in case that you would like to see how it works.
4) <b>Interface - Pet Clinic - linkedin learning</b>
