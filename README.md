# React-start
This repository will consist of really easy examples of React apps and will end in more of complex ones. Nothing to brag about, this will only be my 'safe-place' to store basic content. 

1) <b>Components: </b> First React App. Review how to create and add properties to a component and how to add custom methods.
2) <b>Props and state: </b> Composing components, using states, setStates, passing state as props. Also conditional (and asynchronic) rendering.
