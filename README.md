Have finally started - React. This repository will consist of really easy examples of React apps and will end in more of complex ones. Nothing to brag about, this will only be my 'safe-place' to store basic content. 

1) <b>Components: </b> First React App. Review how to create and add properties to a component and how to add custom methods.
